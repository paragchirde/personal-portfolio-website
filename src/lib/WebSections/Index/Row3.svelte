    I'm a computer science engineer with a specialization in Blockchain, and my journey started as a tech blogger where I developed a keen interest in computer programming. Starting with web development, I continuously experimented and learned through building numerous projects. During my college days, I discovered Blockchain technology and was fascinated by its potential to solve problems at scale. After graduation, I worked at a startup and later co-founded Ortigan, a custom SaaS software development and design company. During the pandemic, I actively participated in teaching students web development fundamentals and headed a Blockchain research program. Sharing knowledge and fostering a culture of learning is a core value of mine. My entrepreneurial journey has been challenging, but it has taught me valuable lessons and helped me grow as a person who can take on any challenge.
